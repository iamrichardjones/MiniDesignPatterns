# Mini-Design Patterns

##Why?
I often mentor/coach more junior members of the software team so wanted use this project as a basis for presenting to graduates/juniors some cute designs I have learnt or used.

##Why Gradle?
It's as pure and simple as me not using it before :smile: I have used Maven and Ant and thought I would try the new kid on the block (at least new to me :wink:)

##What can be contributed?
Anything you think might help. There are a lot on Design Patterns online but what I want here is some of the *mini-design patterns* that you pick up after many hours of coding

##My Coding Mantra
There are some coders that believe the more complex the code the better they are. This can be especially prevalent in more junior
developers. This is the complete opposite of my thought process.
If you are over complicating a problem then you are making it hard for others to read, making it hard for others to maintain and
actually showing your fellow workmates that  you do not have very clear thought processes. After logic is logic and should and 
can be broken down into discrete simple chunks. Code should be simple and easily read. Other people should read your code and 
without hard thinking or head scratching see what is happening and as a bonus even learn some *mini-design patterns*

Please please please along with this project read more on Design Patterns

*Code can and should be elegant*

Just my philosophy so you can get to know who I am and if you want to help contribute to this project
* Do **not** commit code after midday on a Friday. Review again on Monday and see what mistakes you made at the end of the week
* Keep things simple. If they are getting too complicated then divide and conquer
* Unit test everything!
